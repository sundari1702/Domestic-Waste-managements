# Domestic-Waste-managements
This repository is dedicated to providing information, resources, and tools for effectively managing household waste and spread some general awareness among people . And reduce the domestic waste in our localities and keep our surrounding clean and healthy . 
Here are some ideas we have regarding this problem which we are going to present in front of you :
        1.using a image submittion section where people can upload the image of their locality to show the condition of their locality.
        2.having a offline team or (govenment employees) through which we are connected to so that we can share the location and they can go their for the cleaning of that locality.
        3.and generating a reward system so that people are more engaging in this practice of cleanliness.
